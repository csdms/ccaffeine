* Added libtool usage to build. 
 - It is possible, though rather unlikely, that MPI support still works--
    this is an unstable check-in from the build point of view.
 - Started (but not finished) VPATH support for build. 
 - Created single-dir compilation. 
 - Made babel mandatory, even for classic and neo users, because we want 
   babel's libtool.
 - Split gen from depend and depend will probably become a developer-only
   option soon as it eats a lot of useless build time.
 - Split StringConsumerPort into its own library, now that libraries are
   handled very sanely by libtool.
 - Added --enable-single to turn on building serial driver when mpi is
   otherwise present.
 - Added --enable-showlibtool, --enable-makedebug, --enable-showcompile
   to turn on additional build spew, as the build is now very pretty by
   default.
 - Moved readline compilation flags into the configured internal package header.
 - Split a main function into CmdLineBuilderController2_SerialMain.cxx from
   CmdLineBuilderController2.cxx.
 - Got esi directory out of the build by moving mpiwrapper.h.
 - Got rid of unused ID string warnings.
 - Made a semi-useful check target.
 - Fixed some int implicit-casting errors.
 - Updated simpleTests to emit correct messages when static linked.
 - When using mpiCC with libtool, mpiCC may need fixing: 
     '-Wl,-rpath /libdir' should have been '-Wl,-rpath,/libdir'
