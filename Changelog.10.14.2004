To disable classic, --with-cca-classic=no.
The default is that if classic is found, it will be used.
To disable babel, --with-cca-babel=no.
The default is that if babel is found, it will be used.

Fixed simpleTests to bypass classic component sections 
if classic not configured.
Fixed testBatch to pass ldlibrarypath to mpd if set in user env.
Added connectionevents namespace to the opaque core.
Updated configure, makefile.install.
Removed dependencies on cca.h defined macros.
Added --ccafe-remap-stdio switch for batch mode;
if it is not present, stderr/out are left alone and only the IO::
class files get hooked to the framework output. Enough platforms
have trouble with remapping stdout that the default for batch mode
is not to unless --ccafe-remap-stdio is given. The remapeverythingtofile
hangs if --ccafe-remap-stdio is given for mpich/mpd and la mpi at least.


HAVE_CLASSIC is defined at configure time and is accessible
everywhere in the framework internals by including ccafeopq.hh,
or if only the config info is needed, including 
dc/export/config.hh.

The C preprocessor convention for coding with classic is
#ifdef HAVE_CLASSIC
 // classic-dependent stuff here.
#endif // HAVE_CLASSIC

The Makefile convention for coding with classic is
ifeq "$(CLASSIC_CCA_INSTALLED)" "1"
endif

Implementation details:

ConnectionEventService moved into opaque space.
The implementation moved into a separate class
that could in principle become a component (shadowed
per-component) but is currently just a delegated
operation in the Gizzard. So Gizzard no longer
derives from Port in any way and the getClassicPort
operations are out of the Gizzard now.

BblConnectionEventListener.h moved into the babel
binding where it belongs.

Deleted long dead DO_P_LEGACY code.

Retired long dead classic components and ports from old SC demos.
