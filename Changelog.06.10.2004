This is a very minor patch release relative to the
May10 snapshot to work around:
- An error in the cca-spec-neo installation. An example input script used in an
obscure corner of Ccaffeine (ccafe/cxx/dc/neo/test,mpiTest)
contained a hardcoded path.
- An error in BABEL 0.9.2, whereby the env variable SIDL_DEBUG_DLOPEN
got renamed sidl_DEBUG_DLOPEN.
