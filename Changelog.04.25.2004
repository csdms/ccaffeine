Major changes from lemur to final_babel_0_8_8:

1) new binding of the spec (cca-spec-neo) supported.
   configure --with-neo-config=$NEO_PREFIX/bin/cca-spec-neo-config
   Added demonstration of user-defined main/static link from ccaffeine-script
   for neo components in cxx/dc/neo/test; make check.
2) test hack ParameterDialogServiceTest replaced with
   spec conformant ParameterPortFactoryTest .
3) added --enable-mono switch to configure to get black/white gui.
   color scheme is switchable/adjustable by modifying
   ccafe/java/gov/sandia/ccaffeine/dc/user_iface/gui/CustomColors.java and
   ccafe/java/gov/sandia/ccaffeine/dc/user_iface/gui/ccafeGUI.properties
4) brought lots of code into line with cca-spec-babel exception 
   specifications.
5) cleaned out ruby dependencies. no longer needed.
6) added Babel ParameterPortFactoryTest to demonstrate 
   porting to ParameterPort spec from classic to babel.
7) fixed lots of memory leaks. Much by replacing char * with std::string.
8) dropped KeyValuePort use.
9) lots of fixes to socket code type conflicts in cxx/dc/distributed/.
10) the 'opaque' class typedefs in cxx/dc/export have been regularized
    and all deviant usages removed. If an error message containing some
    'undefined class/struct {blah} *Opaque*' occurs when compiling
    formerly working code, see cxx/dc/export/ccafeopq.hh for the
    correct type.
11) Added support for cca.sidl ComponentRelease interface. Components
    wishing to be notified of being shutdown should implement
    ComponentRelease.
12) Added support for ServiceRegistry/ServiceProvider in namespace ccaffeine
    prior to its approval by cca.
13) Added the ability to globally dynamic-load port definitions 
    for classic/neo without loading a component. script syntax:
    cca>  repository get-ports libraryPathName
14) Added events model definitions. not yet used in ConnectionFramework,
    however, pending use of a more public standard.
15) Full support for Babel bound AbstractFramework/BuilderService.
16) Added add/removeExternalComponent interface to ConnectionFramework, needed
    to handle getServices from AbstractFramework properly.
17) Made sidl ParameterPorts opaque so that they can be accessed from all
    bindings if desired.
18) .depl.cca XML support.
19) Component visibility properties support.
