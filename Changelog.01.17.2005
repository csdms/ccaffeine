* Debugged libtool usage in build. 
 - MPI support works at least for mpich style compiler wrappers.
 - When using mpiCC with libtool, broken mpiCC' may need fixing: 
     '-Wl,-rpath /libdir' should have been '-Wl,-rpath,/libdir'
 - Depend is now a developer-only option as it eats a lot of 
   useless build time. --enable-developer at configure time 
   turns on depend targets for those editing code.
 - Updated simpleTests to use valgrind or a debugger if CCAFE_DEBUGGER
   is set manually in the environment. Set CCAFE_DEBUGGER to the XYZ
   tool you are using that would normally appear 'XYZ ./ccafe-client'
   when invoking ccaffeine+debugger.
 - Added make post-install-check for those tests that require
   an installed directory of component shared libraries/.cca files.
 - Added correctly handling of -R flags for libtool since neocca lib is
   not libtoolified.
 - Added build progress counter. Conceivably this should be a developer
   only thing.
 - Got rid of redundant build of ccaffeine objects in various components.
