# NOTE: the authors of ccaffeine are *extremely* skeptical
# of all known automatic dynamic-loading dependency tracking
# and resolution schemes (most break readily).
#
# As such, our code is written to require FULL path names
# to .so files being loaded. The files are loaded privately
# (not into the global symbol table), with symbol access
# being explicitly through CCA_DynamicSymbol/dlsym.

#       DL_LIBS -       Library file(s) to include in demo and other base

#       LD_FLAGS -      Flags to pass to the compiler when linking object
#                       files into an executable application binary such
#                       as demo-client.

#       LD_SEARCH_FLAGS-Flags to pass to ld, such as "-R /usr/local/cca/lib",
#                       that tell the run-time dynamic linker where to look
#                       for shared libraries such as libTextView.so.  Depends on
#                       the variable LIB_RUNTIME_DIR in the Makefile.

#       SHLIB_CFLAGS -  Flags to pass to cc when compiling the components
#                       of a shared library (may request position-independent
#                       code, among other things).

#                       into a shared library.

#       SHLIB_LD_LIBS - Dependent libraries for the linker to scan when
#                       creating shared libraries.  This symbol typically
#                       goes at the end of the "ld" commands that build
#                       shared libraries. The value of the symbol is
#                       "${LIBS}" if all of the dependent libraries should
#                       be specified when creating a shared library.  If
#                       dependent libraries should not be specified (as on
#                       SunOS 4.x, where they cause the link to fail, or in
#                       general if demo mains aren't themselves shared
#                       libraries), then this symbol has an empty string
#                       as its value.

#       SHLIB_SUFFIX -  Suffix to use for the names of dynamically loadable
#                       extensions.  An empty string means we don't know how
#                       to use shared libraries on this platform.
