Feature change for classic migration to neo:
- Generic classic ports can be tagged via portinfo as being
exportable to neo components. (Note this does not need to be
done for special components that are bound in the ccaffeine
opaque layer, like "GoPort".
If a port implementation
is castable to both neo::cca::Port * and classic::gov::cca::Port *,
then we can inform the framework this is the case
by adding property key "SupportsKind" and value "c++-cca-spec-neo"
in the createPortInfo(n,t,props) call.
char *props[3]; 
props[2]=0; props[0]="SupportsKind"; props[1]="c++-cca-spec-neo"
pi=createPortInfo(n,t,props)
addProvidesPort(this,pi);

Bug fix for all builderservice implementations:
- The BuilderService call to get connections on a list of components
was (due to an error elsewhere) providing only the connections
in which the component was the user. Now any connection touching
any component in the list is included, per the specification.
Thanks to Maria Liu for reporting the problem.
