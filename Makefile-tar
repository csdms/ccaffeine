# ben's not a big believer in "cleaning up" a working
# repository just for export, so instead everyone
# can just list their own exclusions. See 
# exclude-from-tar.all and exclude-from-tar.baallan
# for examples.
# Take care that your wildcarding, if any, doesn't
# exclude other people's files by accident.
