Each subdirectory here is intended to be a self-contained
example demonstrating use of an installed ccaffeine. 
Each has it own configure which must be independent
of the ccaffeine build (but not the ccaffeine installation,
obviously).

In this directory we give a hint file (based on the build of
ccaffeine) with suggestions for arguments to the configures
in the subdirectories.
