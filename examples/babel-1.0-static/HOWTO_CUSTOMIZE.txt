All you really need to change is test-input.scr.in
and MakeIncl.user to do your actions and point at your components.

The babel code skeleton here knows nothing about
the specific components mentioned in test-input.scr.in.
The Makefile skeleton here knows nothing about components
except what it is told in MakeIncl.user or derives
from the .cca files.

How we do it:

1) bld2babel-cpp processes the input script test-input.scr
and extracts the commands that manipulate BuilderService as well as
the component information (most headers, most libraries)
from the .depl.cca files needed to build a batch-oriented executable.
You need the latest (2/2005) version of genCCASCL.sh to build
your .cca files and you need to feed into genCCASCL.sh
the library and header information.

2) bld2babel-cpp is not yet psychic, so if the headers
for specific ports are needed, you may need to add
a line (such as that for StringConsumerPort) in the input file.

3) bld2babel-cpp is not yet psychic, so if the libraries
for specific ports are needed, you may need to add
a line (such as that for StringConsumerPort) in the MakeIncl.user

4) The compile and link are handled with babel-libtool to keep
the dynamic linking flags consistent with those used in building
the cca-spec and ccaffeine libraries. This could be done
otherwise for a specific platform.
