This is a large patch release for bugs and build features:
It requires the latest version of cca-spec-neo, 0.2.2 if neo
support is configured in.

- Go ports in all bindings are now mapped to opaque goports
  so any component can call any go port on any other component.
- Classic components can provide any port as both classic port and
  neo port by doing the following:
        1) the component must inherit from neo::cca::Port (note: NOT
                neo::cca::Component). This is sufficient for gcc, but
                other compilers may require that the specific port
                itself inherit from both neo::cca::Port 
                and classic::gov::cca::Port.
        2) The component must provide the SupportsKind property to 
                the framework at the time of createPortInfo/addProvidesPort
                which inform the frame that the port can be accessed from 
                neo components as well. E.g. in setServices:

        //Provide a PerfParamPort, courtesy Nick Trebon.
          char * props[3];
          props[0] = "SupportsKind";
          props[1] = "c++-cca-spec-neo";
          props[2] = 0;
          portInfo = frameworkServices->createPortInfo( "PerfParamPort",
                       "perfparam.ccaports.PerfParamPort", props );
          if (portInfo != 0) {
            frameworkServices->addProvidesPort (this, portInfo);
          }
  Notes:
        1) For classic::gov::cca::GoPort the above mechanics are not needed.
        2) Nothing of the above applies to Babel components calling on
           classic or neo components. 
        3) The reverse case (classic components calling neo ports)
           is not supported yet, if ever. All users of classic should be
           migrating to neo or babel at this point.
        
- configure now accepts --with-mpi-ld=/some/executable
  mpi-ld is used for the final linking of executables and
  defaults to mpi-cxx if not given explicitly. If no mpi,
  mpi-ld is c++ or equivalent.
- Added GoComponent example in babel for testing.
- Added PortConverter concept in classic binding.
- Fixed mpi ports to work in neo.
