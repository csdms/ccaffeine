  Map of what is and what might be for remote UI/HPC framework communication
  in CCAFFEINE<br>
  </center>
  </h1>

  <h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>

  <p>CCAFFEINE (Common Component Architecture Fast Framework Example In Need
  of Everything) is the first Sandia testbed implementation of a component
  software framework supporting the standards proposals published by the
  Common Component Architecture Forum.  Our two purposes in writing are to
  solicit technical suggestions and criticism (dope slaps?) for the proposed
  version 1 wire protocol currently in design for CCAFFEINE and to document
  the allegedly scalable command and control structure and the version 0 wire
  protocol presently used in CCAFFEINE.<br>
  </p>

  <p>First, we very briefly review the current command and control strategy
  used in CCAFFEINE. It would be overstating the case to claim that the
  accumulated code which handles these tasks was designed beyond the most
  basic structural levels.  Second section, we list the objectives we believe
  need to be considered when replacing the remote control layer. Finally, we
  present an initial design of the replacement for review by the larger
  community.<br>
  </p>

  <h2><b>Command, control, and communications anatomy of CCAFFEINE</b></h2>

  <p>We document the current wire protocol and message transport scheme used
  in CCAFFEINE for the runtime management of HPC software components to
  motivate a new design and to capture many relevant use-cases. We are not
  writing a reference manual to support future users of an existing product.
  We hope the documentation of several failings in the initial implementation
  may save time for later implementers and designers. <br>
  </p>

  <h3><b><a name="Servers">UI Servers and SPMD Clients</a></b></h3>

  <p>(Put some pictures here that explain our sockets, muxers, and
  CmdLineBuildViews and the process of starting up CCAFFEINE).</p>

  <h3><b>Existing (G)UI features (5/2000)</b></h3>

  <p>As seen in <a href="#Servers">UI Servers and SPMD Clients</a>  the
  CCAFFEINE GUI drives the framework by sending it strings through a socket
  connection. Thus each GUI feature is implemented as some combination of
  framework line-oriented commands and (minimal) GUI-cached data. We will
  document the command-line syntax and semantics in <a
  href="#Appendix">Appendix A</a>.<br>
  </p>

  <p>The current CCAFFEINE GUI has buttons, features, and bindings (actions)
  as summarized in the following list. We name these items in a dot notation
  to indicate a conceptual hierarchy that organizes the information and
  functions delivered by the GUI. This does not correspond to a specific
  hierarchy of widgets in the implementation or to a specific display
  layout.<br>

  <h3>Shortcomings</h3>
  <li>The present GUI and underlying sockets cannot go away and come back
    later in a long running job.</li>
  <li>There is no generic mechanism for special rendering of framework
    service-linked ports such as Go, ParameterDialog, Stop, ConnectionEvent,
    DisconnectionEvent, ParameterChangeEvent, HumanLineOutput,
    UIMessageOutput, HumanLineInput, HumanErrorOutput, MPIService,
    ConfirmationDialog, etc, etc, etc.</li>
  <li>There is no GUI mechanism for adding components from a repository.</li>
  <li>The gui (and underlying framework) do not account for the possibility
    that components may live on a subset of the remote processors.</li>
  <li>The gui, the underlying framework, and the CCA standard on which these
    are based do not anticipate a port existing on only the lead processor in
    the set of processors where the component is instantiated.</li>

  <h2>WHAT OUGHT probably TO BE</h2>

  <h3>Scope, objectives and constraints</h3>

  <h4>Desired product scope</h4>

  <p>We seek a wire protocol (event strings over sockets) for managing a
  heavy, remote, "mostly single threaded" parallel framework from
  java/tk/python/other shell languages.  The protocol should be such that a
  GUI can optimize some aspects of its rendering while becoming consistent
  with the remote framework state if the user waits an appropriate amount of
  time. In particular, it should not be such that the GUI offers services
  before they are really there or that it continues to offer services after
  they are definitely *not* there. Given lags in network transport and long
  pauses while computations progress, it is not efficient to fully synchronize
  a largely passive (frame the parallel job then get out of the way) remote
  GUI rendering with its phalanx of controlled processes. This scope may be
  rather distinct from the loosely coupled system represented by the Indiana
  framework.</p>
</ul>

<h4>Expected results</h4>
<ul>
  <p>The framework and protocols we describe here are aimed at supporting
  framework developers, component developers, and component testers using the
  software on a workstation emulating a multiprocessor or a small set of
  processors in a larger SPMD machine. Most tightly coupled, massively
  parallel platforms we are aware of provide such an interactive environment
  for development purposes, while production runs are large, batch-queued, and
  non-interactive. Interaction with production runs is often through
  examination of periodically dumped checkpoint files or editing of a
  periodically reread parameter file.</p>

  <p>The minimum result we require from CCAFFEINE is that the actions of an
  interactive session can be recorded as a script which can be reread as the
  control file for a non-interactive production run where only a lightweight
  C++ framework backend is present. The other result we expect to obtain is
  that we can generate a C++ main() which is equivalent to the script, but
  requires no string interpreters and only an extremely lightweight framework
  backend without the CCAFFEINE control sockets outlined in <a
  href="#Servers">UI Servers and SPMD Clients</a>.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
  <h4>Other objectives</h4>

  <p></p>
  <li>Make the remote UI/GUI as passive as possible. I.e. whereever possible,
    the UI is simply a listener to (and renderer of) the output events.</li>
  <li>Let the UI/GUI come and go while the framework runs.</li>
  <li>Use a protocol <b><i>identical</i></b> for both Java and C++ frameworks
    to facilitate testing.</li>
  <li>Use a protocol implementation as nearly identical for both Java and C++
    frameworks as possible to reduce development cost.</li>

  <h4>General behaviors needed at a low level</h4>

  <p></p>
  <li>Let the GUI can preempt (cancel) instructions (queued in framework) it
    already received from the user by sending framework a later cancel/stop.
    This means the GUI must not hang waiting for an answer to an instruction
    that never arrived.</li>
  <li>Let the framework silently refuse to queue new instructions from the
    GUI. This means the GUI must not hang waiting for an answer to an
    instruction that never arrived.</li>
  <li>Let the GUI immediately do every command it receives from the
  framework.</li>
  <li>Disallow the GUI from on its own flushing the queue of events it
    receives from the framework or refuse to queue new commands. GUI can only
    remove itself from the listeners on the framework by the appropriate
    detach protocol. This shouldn't be an issue since the GUI shouldn't be
    running a queue of any sort on the framework events in the first
  place.</li>

            containerTitle &lt;name> &lt;title> <br>
            pallet begin &lt;name><br>

            [repeat newComponent until list done]<b><br>
            arena end &lt;name></b></blockquote>

          <p>GUI renders named pallet and arena into its collection of pages
          on receipt of the <i>arena/pallet end &lt;name></i>. The pallet may
          be empty. (The GUI has a separate facility to support the framework
          api that adds classes to a (possibly empty) pallet. The arena may be
          empty. It may not if the framework chooses to preinstantiate some
          components always!</p>

          <p>Notes: The GUI cannot be certain the framework is done with a new
          container and should be capable of accurate partial rendering of the
          container. Similarly, the GUI cannot be certain of receiving either
          <i>pallet end &lt;name></i> or <i>arena end &lt;name></i>. The
          intent of the "end" events is to give the GUI a backstop event for
          those times where the GUI wants to skip the rendering phase of
          adding to its list of managed classes/instances until "all" have
          been received or a specified timeout since last newClass event has
          occured. This allows optimization (minimization) of GUI redraws;
          e.g. wait until all the classes are in (or a timeout) and then
          resize pallet to hold the widest label.</p>

          <p>Notes: It may be desirable for the GUI to queue to itself the
          teardown event to be done in X seconds. The containerClose event
          from the framework should cause immediate de-rendering of the
          container on the GUI side. A teardown event on a non-existent
          container must not be an error. Tearing down a container must cause
          cancel and teardown of any open dialogs associated with it.
          containerClose &lt;name> may also generate messages as in "remove

<h1><a name="Appendix">Appendix A</a>: Version 0 command Line and wire

The line-oriented string API is identical in the Java and C++ implementations
of CCAFFEINE. The table below is an annotated version of the syntax and
semantics described by the "help" command of the command-line interpreter.
Arguments given in square brackets are [optional]. Arguments in angle brackets
are &lt;required>. Commands may be abbreviated to the minimum number of
characters needed to be unique among possible commands. Class and instance
name arguments are fuzzy matched (watch out!) while Port names must be
specified exactly. The parser is case sensitive.

<h1><a name="Appendix1">Appendix B</a>: Generic Configuration Parameter
Dialog</h1>

<p>We provide a basic, UI-independent parameter input request protocol that
lets the component developer assume primitive input sanity. One GUI rendering
of the input request protocol, the paramDialog,  is described in the second
table below. The first table below gives the protocol itself, the
line-oriented commands sent from the framework to the GUI. The UI optional
response to these commands is to send back configure commands for one or more
of the fields of the parameter dialog according to the description in <a
href="#Appendix">Appendix A</a>.</p>

<p>The protocol could be easily replaced with a single dialog display command
using an XML description of the parameter input request. The series of
commands is sent in an order that will allow any reasonable object-oriented UI
implementation to build temporary data structures needed to negotiate with the
user.</p>

<p>The first shortcoming of the protocol is that it may need to have inserted
a lead argument to all commands which lets the UI discriminate among multiple
containers. I.e. everywhere in the protocol that arguments <i>instance
port</i> appear we may need to extend to <i>containerInstance instance port
</i>. The second shortcoming of the protocol is that it requires the UI
implementation to associate each paramField received with the most recently
received paramTab in the given dialog. It would be preferable to include a
tabName  in the arguments associated with individual fields.</p>

<table border="1">
  <caption>UI-independent parameter request commands from framework to
  GUI</caption>

    <tr>
      <td>paramDialog</td>
      <td><b>arguments: &lt;instanceName> &lt;portName>
        &lt;dialogTitle...></b>

        <p>Inform the UI that the framework wants a dialog to get the values
        of one or more scalar variables (parameter fields) from the user. Each
        port of type ParameterPort on a CCA instance is associated with a
        separate dialog. There may be several such ports, uniquely named,  per
        instance.  The dialogTitle is a string terminated by the newline. It
        cannot be empty.</p>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>paramTab</td>
      <td><b>arguments: &lt;instanceName> &lt;portName> &lt;groupTitle...></b>

        <p>When the dialog has lots of fields, they need to be broken up into
        groups of more closely related values. This is typically graphically
        rendered as a tabbed dialog or other series of panels. The groupTitle
        is a string, as the dialog title. It cannot be empty.</p>

    <tr>
      <td>paramField</td>
      <td><b>arguments: &lt;instanceName> &lt;portName> &lt;fieldType>
        &lt;fieldName></b>

        <p>Add a new field to the most recently defined group. FieldType is
        one of: DOUBLE, INT, FLOAT, LONG, BOOL, and STRING.</p>

    <tr>
      <td>paramPrompt</td>
      <td><b>arguments: &lt;instanceName> &lt;portName> &lt;fieldName>

        <p>With each field is a (hopefully concise) string to clue the user
        about what is reqested.   The promptString cannot be empty.</p>

        <p>Each field has a current value. Only in the case of un-enumerated
        STRING fields is it possible that the value is empty, in which case
        the degenerate form of the command will occur:</p>

        <p><b>arguments: &lt;instanceName> &lt;portName>
        &lt;fieldName></b></p>

        paramCurrent.</p>

      <td>paramNumberRange</td>
      <td><b>arguments: &lt;instanceName> &lt;portName> &lt;fieldName>

        <p>The numerical field types have lower and upper bounds. The UI must
        use these to filter out bogus input.</p>

    <tr>
      <td>paramStringChoice</td>
      <td><b>arguments: &lt;instanceName> &lt;portName> &lt;fieldName>

        <p>For STRING parameters which are limited to a selection (such as
        from a pulldown list) each choice of value is sent in a separate
        command of this form.</p>

      </td>

        <p>Each field may have a longer explanation associated with it. That
        explanation is in the form of a string. It should not be rendered by
        default, but only when the user asks for it.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>paramEndDialog</td>
      <td><b>arguments: &lt;instanceName> &lt;portName></b>

        <p>This optional command tells the UI that the framework is done
        sending information about the dialog specified by instance and port.
        The UI may choose to render the dialog partially as commands are
        received from the framework. When a paramEndDialog is received, the UI
        must render, if it has not already. The UI might,  if a reasonable
        timeout has expired since the last command wrt the dialog was
        received, assume the dialog request is complete and render anyway.</p>
