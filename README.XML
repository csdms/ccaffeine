Update May 2004, Ben Allan, SNL/CA
babel-0.9.2 release note:
If XML is not configured in, babel dynamic loading is unlikely to work.
This is due to babel, not to Ccaffeine.

October 7, 2003, Ben Allan, SNL/CA

WHAT:
We (in the drive to raise N to infinity where N is the 
number of other libraries the user must have before using
ccaffeine) now support xml formatted .cca files 
class description for locating components, in
addition to the old ccaffeine style. 


BUILDING:
This support is optional. If libxml2 cannot be located
by configure (through xml2-config), then we do
not support xml formatted .cca files.
./configure has 3 new switches, of which one is likely needed
if the program xml2-config is not in your path:

a) --with-xml2-config=/where/you/hid/xml2/bin/xml2-config
b) --with-xml2-includes='flags for compiling with xml headers'
c) --with-xml2-libs='libs you need in -l form'

If (a) fails, try giving b & c, but don't expect miracles.


USING:
Copious examples of supported formats are provided in subdirectory
cxx/dc/services/dotcca/examples/*.depl.cca
cxx/dc/services/dotcca/examples/oldDotCCA/*cca

The script for generating XML .cca files is provided in
cxx/util/genDLIndexXML
Invoke cxx/util/genDLIndexXML without arguments
to get the argument syntax.


FUTURE WORK:
The BABEL xml file for a given class has almost enough in it
to be used as a .cca file. It lacks a tag for the .so
deployment path. If the .sidl and the .so file happened
to both live in the same directory, we could make something
of this. As it is, the current dotcca parser accepts
BABEL xml files as input and detects whether the class
described is a CCA component.


BUG NOTES:
The 'make install' target still doesn't
handle the case where xml is missing or configured out. 
For linux, libxml2 is always there (nearly) and this
isn't a panic to fix yet. Not too hard.
