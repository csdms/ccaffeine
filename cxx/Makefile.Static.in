# This file defines the linker flags for extra babel component libraries to be
# directly linked with ccafeCore. This is strictly a hackaround and should
# not be used in the long term-- see the ccagm gen-cca-main static main
# generator for a long term solution. This actually works with either
# static or dynamic linking.
#
# Note well: this does not write the code automatically that must be
# added to cxx/dc/framework/BabelStaticFactory.cxx to register
# specific application classes. You have to do your own C++ client
# generation and call the c++ create for your class in addClasses.
#
# e.g. to preload mpi component link

# in the following 2 defines, you can use anything, not just babel libraries.
