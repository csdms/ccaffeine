CCAFFEINE 0.8
c++ release notes and BUILD Instructions:

BUILD:
You will need (or probably want):
- mpi
You must have:
- gmake
- ANSI c compiler, ISO C++ 3 compiler
- java2 (jdk1.4 for linux) in order to use babel. build babel first.
- a copy of cca-spec-[neo,classic,babel] as suits you. at least one
must be installed.

% cd dccafe/ (cd ../ from here: cxx/)
% ./configure --prefix=/some/place/else --with-cs[b,c,n]-config=$specprefix/bin/cca-spec-[babel,neo,classic]-config
[lot of other configure options exist for mpi, etc. that you may need]

Edit Makefile.conf.dl, Makefile.Vars if needed.
% make
% make install
% cd dc/user_iface
% cp CcaffeineRC ~/.ccaferc if desired for customization.
% # assuming dccafe is checked out into ~/

Run ccafe-single from whereever you installed (/some/place/else/bin)
This gets you the serial (np=1) commandline framework
cca> ? (for help)
cca> path init
cca> pallet 
You get the idea. 'help <command>' will tell you about a
particular command.
