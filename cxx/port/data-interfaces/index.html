<title>Some data-related abstractions from dec 2000 cca meeting</title>
<body>

Draft interfaces developed in the data-oriented premeeting, late
at night.
<p>
<a href="dec2000.h">A header for some scratchy interfaces</a>
</p>
<p><a href="test/index.html">Generated doc++ version.</a>
</p>
<p><a href="test-data/html/index.html">Generated doxygen version.</a>
</p>
<p>
Attending the premeeting were many people, the list of whom Lori Freitag
has. My faulty recollection is that the headers above were produced by
Craig Rasmussen, David Berholdt, Jaideep Ray, Jim Kohl, Ray Loy, and Ben Allan.
If you are incorrectly included or omitted in this list, please send me
the correction.
